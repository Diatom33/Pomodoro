# Pomodoro
This is a hacky little command line [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) script I wrote mostly for my own use, since I wanted to have more customizable time blocks. 
## Features that a "standard" Pomodoro timer doesn't have:
- custom length of each time period in a cycle
- custom number of time periods in a cycle
- system notifications and beeping, both optional, when each time period ends
- ability to save and load multiple presets

## Future features I might add:
- support for popups on Mac (conditional on any Mac users actually wanting to use this)
- delaying start of next time period until after the popup has been dismissed (already implemented on Windows)
- web UI
